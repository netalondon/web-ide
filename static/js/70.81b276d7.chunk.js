It includes the following tools:\n\n**Hardware simulator:** Used to create chips. Features a built-in HDL editor and all the necessary services for simulating and testing chips. Relevant Nand to Tetris projects: 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\n**CPU Emulator:** Emulates the Hack computer (CPU, RAM, ROM, Screen, Keyboard). Allows loading the computer\u2019s instruction memory with machine language code stored in an external file, or entering machine language code directly into the instruction memory. Features a built-in assembler which is invoked automatically if the loaded/entered code is written in the Hack assembly language. Used mainly in Nand to Tetris project 4, for running and testing programs written in the Hack assembly language.\n\n**Assembler:** Used to translate programs written in the Hack assembly language into code written in Hack binary code. Used in Nand to Tetris project 6, for two purposes: (i) Learning how the Hack assembler works, and (ii) Comparing the code generated by the user\u2019s assembler to code created by a correctly-implemented assembler.\n\n**Bitmap editor:** Used for designing visual elements (like sprites) and generating either the Hack or Jack code that implements them. Can be used in Nand to Tetris projects 4 or 9, to help develop computer games and interactive applications that feature graphics and animation.\n\n**Forthcoming tools:** VM emulator (projects 7,8,9) and Jack compiler (projects 9,10,11,12), both with OS support.\n\n---\n\n**Team:** This online IDE is an open source, freely available, and ongoing project. The project\u2019s initiator, architect, and main developer is David Souther. Neta London fixed bugs and added many extensions. Eric Umble developed the bitmap editor. The Nand to Tetris teaching/learning approach, the Hack computer, and related languages were designed by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.\n\n**The desktop Nand2Tetris Software Suite** (sometimes called \u201ckit\u201d): This venerable working horse, which operated faithfully for many years and supported 250,000+ users on every possible PC/OS configuration, was developed by Yaron Ukrainintz, Nir Rozen, and Yannai Gonczarowski. The first bitmap editor was developed by Golan Parashi. The desktop software suite is still available. It can be used along with, or instead of, the online IDE.\n"})})}),o=r},4216:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{Z:()=>d});var a=t(5600),i=t(8404),r=t(6415),o=t(864);const s=e=>(e=e.replace("%25PUBLIC_URL%25","/web-ide"),(0,a.A)(e)),d=e=>{let{children:n}=e;return(0,o.jsx)(i.D,{remarkPlugins:[r.Z],transformImageUri:s,children:n})}}}]);
